# Lego Robot Programming

This is the code my partner and I wrote to program an Lego Arduino robot.
The robot follows a dark line on the floor until it hits a wall.
It then backs up and plays the music you hear when you encounter a pokemon in the gameboy games while spinning.
The screen displays an animation that spirals inward, and depending on which bumper hit the wall, displays a pokemon.
After this, it finds the dark line it was following and follows it in the opposite direction.
